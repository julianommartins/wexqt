<td><h3>Natural Language Query (NLQ) Help</h3></td>
</tr></table>
<p>Watson Explorer Natural Language Querying (NLQ) improves the user search experience by allowing the user to query Watson Explorer using natural language queries such as questions like "Im searching for a Java Developer in Brazil who know Hibernate and spring. Band 6 or 7 its ok.".</p>
<p>To use NLQ you must use the TEXTSEARCH 'statement' and also check the Natural Language Querying box.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> SELECT 
FIELDS PRACTITIONER_ID, FULL_NAME, WORK_LOCATION_IMT, PRIMARY_JRSS, SECONDARY_JRSS
FACETS WORK_LOCATION_IMT
FROM PMP_Practitioner 
WHERE TEXTSEARCH 'Virtual Private Network'</p></br>
In this example, WEX will search for people who have Virtual Private Network keyword. 
<p><b>Example 2:</b>
SELECT 
FIELDS PRACTITIONER_ID, FULL_NAME, WORK_LOCATION_IMT, JOB_ROLE,DEPLOYABILITY, PRIMARY_JRSS, SECONDARY_JRSS, COMPETENCY 
FACETS WORK_LOCATION_IMT, WORK_LOCATION_CITY 
FROM PMP_Practitioner 
WHERE
TEXTSEARCH 'I want a Network Support Specialist that have experience with Virtual Private Network and live in China' 
NUM 50 SORTBY $PRIMARY_JRSS</p>
<p><b>Example 3:</b> SELECT 
FIELDS PRACTITIONER_ID, FULL_NAME, WORK_LOCATION_IMT, PRIMARY_JRSS, SECONDARY_JRSS
FACETS WORK_LOCATION_IMT
FROM PMP_Practitioner 
WHERE TEXTSEARCH 'I want a Cobol programmer with Financial Services experience and prior project experience with Merril Lynch is highly desirable'</p>

<h3>NLQ + Filters (AKA Facet Filters)</h3>
<p>You can use NLQ with more filters, using Facets, in this case you must use the filter and add the TEXTSEARCH statement like in the following examples. <b>See that we dont have AND beetwen the filter and the TEXTSEARCH.</b></p>
<p><b>Example 1:</b> SELECT 
FIELDS PRACTITIONER_ID, FULL_NAME, WORK_LOCATION_IMT, PRIMARY_JRSS, SECONDARY_JRSS
FACETS WORK_LOCATION_IMT
FROM PMP_Practitioner 
WHERE  $WORK_LOCATION_IOT='Latin America'
TEXTSEARCH 'Virtual Private Network'</br>
In this example, WEX will search for people who have Virtual Private Network keyword and IOT = Latin America. </p>

<p><b>Example with 2 conditions:</b> SELECT 
FIELDS PRACTITIONER_ID, FULL_NAME, WORK_LOCATION_IMT, PRIMARY_JRSS, SECONDARY_JRSS
FACETS WORK_LOCATION_IMT, WORK_LOCATION_CITY
FROM PMP_Practitioner 
WHERE  $WORK_LOCATION_IMT='Brazil' and $WORK_LOCATION_CITY='HORTOLANDIA'
TEXTSEARCH 'Virtual Private Network'</p>

<p>Wex dont have a maximum number of conditions, but keep in mind that any added condition will represent more effort from WEX (CPU and Memory).</p>
